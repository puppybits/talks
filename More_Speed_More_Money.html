# The Importance of Speed 

* People won’t wait for you. 
* Slow pages increases **abandonment rate**.
* Slow pages increases **bounce rate**.
* Slow pages have **decreased reveune**. 
* Slow pages have **increased customer support**.

# Fast Pages Case Studies - barackobama.com

* Obama’s campaign website found that faster page loads increase conversion rate 14%<sup>([Kyle Rush](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/))</sup>.

* Obama’s online fund raising earned $250 million dollars.  

* $250,000,000 / 14% = $35,000,000

* If every donar gave the same amount, the potential lose for a slow site would be as high as $35 million dollars.

# Fast Pages Case Studies - bing.com

Bing lost -4.3% revenue per user on slow page loads. <sup>([Bing](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/detail/8523) [[]](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/29/The%20User%20and%20Business%20Impact%20of%20Server%20Delays,%20Additional%20Bytes,%20and%20HTTP%20Chunking%20in%20Web%20Search%20Presentation.pptx))</sup>

# Quantifiy UX Targets

# Targets

* Speed - How fast is fast enough?
* Size - How much data can be loaded?
* Type - What improvements will give the best results?
  
---
# Targets - 2 seconds

<ul>
<li>
  <b style="color: brown">Speed - TTI (Time to Interact) 2 seconds</b>
</li>
<li>Size - How much data can be loaded?</li>
<li>Type - What improvements will give the best results?</li>
</ul>

Numerous case studies from Bing, Amazon, Facebook, Shopzilla, Firefox and others all talk around the same threshold. Decreasing speeds down to 2 seconds have major impact on retention and revenue. Faster than a 2 second have diminishing returns <sup>[guypo](http://www.guypo.com/17-statistics-to-sell-web-performance-optimization/)</sup>.
  
Time to Interact the best metric to quanitify the user persepction on speed. It can be the same as Time to First Paint as long as there is usage content on the page.

# Targets - 400KB

* Speed - TTI (Time to Interact) 2 seconds
<li>
  <b style="color: brown">Size - 400KB to render above the fold</b>
</li>
* Type - What improvements will give the best results?

Time is relative to the user’s internet connection. 

In 2015 users coming from mobile connections on major web sites was between 38% to 58% depending on the content type<sup>[Clickz](http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2388915/why-mobile-web-still-matters-in-2015)</sup>. 3G only mobile users is 50.3% of the users and LTE Mobile users are only on LTE 56.5% of the time<sup>[OpenSignal](http://opensignal.com/reports/state-of-lte/usa-q1-2014/)</sup>.  

This means around 40% of users could be accessing your site over a 3G connection. A decent 3G connection is 0.2 Megabytes Per Second (1.6Mbps). With the 2 second threshold that provide 400KB of data total to render the page in the target.

# Targets - 63.4% of page weight is `<img>`

* Speed - Time to Interact 2,000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
* Size - 400KB
<li>
  <b style="color: brown">Type - Images are 63.4% (1.3MB) of the page weight</b>
</li>

In September 2015, HTTP Archive has the average site is 2.2MB (2,182KB). The largest type of resource are images, which account for 1.3MB (2.1KB). <sup>[HTTP Archive](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php)</sup>
   
On 3G mobile connections where bandwidth is the most limited, the average site would take 11 seconds to load.

# Speed with Ease

# Speed with Ease

### Resize-Image-Loader + ResponsiveImage 

```javascript
let ResponseImage = require('ResponsiveImage');
let image = require(`resize-image?
  sizes[]=200w,
  sizes[]=900w,
  !assets/img/my-image.png`);


let MyComponent = React.createClass({
  render(){
    return (<ResponsiveImage src={image} />);
  }
}); 
```
