# Fast Pages Case Studies - barackobama.com

Obama’s campaign website found that faster page loads increase conversion rate 14%.<sup>([Kyle Rush](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/))</sup>  

* Obama’s online fund raising earned $250 million dollars.  

* $250,000,000 / 14% = $35,000,000

* If every donar gave the same amount, the potential lose for a slow site would be as high as $35 million dollars.

# Targets - 2 seconds

* <b style="color: brown">Speed - TTI (Time to Interact) 2 seconds</b>
* Size - How much data can be loaded?
* Type - What gives the best results?


Numerous case studies from Bing, Amazon, Facebook, Shopzilla, Firefox and others all talk around the same threshold. Decreasing speeds down to 2 seconds have major impact on retention and revenue. Faster than a 2 second have diminishing returns.<sup>[guypo](http://www.guypo.com/17-statistics-to-sell-web-performance-optimization/)</sup>
  
Time to Interact the best metric to quanitify the user persepction on speed. It can be the same as Time to First Paint as long as there is usage content on the page.

# Targets - 400KB

* Speed - TTI (Time to Interact) 2 seconds
* <b style="color: brown">Size - 400KB to render above the fold</b>
* Type - What gives the best results?

Time is relative to the user’s internet connection. 

In 2015 users coming from mobile connections on major web sites was between 38% to 58% depending on the content type.<sup>[Clickz](http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2388915/why-mobile-web-still-matters-in-2015)</sup>  
3G only mobile users account for 50.3% of the users.<sup>[OpenSignal](http://opensignal.com/reports/state-of-lte/usa-q1-2014/)</sup>    
LTE Mobile users are only on LTE 56.5% of the time.<sup>[OpenSignal](http://opensignal.com/reports/state-of-lte/usa-q1-2014/)</sup>  

This means around 40% of users could be accessing your site over a 3G connection. A decent 3G connection is 0.2 Megabytes Per Second (1.6Mbps). With the 2 second threshold that provide 400KB of data total to render the page in the target.

</li>

In September 2015, HTTP Archive has the average site is 2.2MB (2,182KB). The largest type of resource are images, which account for 1.3MB (2.1KB). <sup>[HTTP Archive](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php)</sup>
   
On 3G mobile connections where bandwidth is the most limited, the average site would take 11 seconds to load.

# Speed with Ease

### Resize-Image-Loader (<a href="bit.ly/resize-image">bit.ly/resize-image</a>) + </br> ResponsiveImage (<a href="bit.ly/react-image">bit.ly/react-image</a>)
    
**Resize-Image-Loader** for Webpack will create and optimize multiple image variants and include them with your distribution folder.  

```bash
npm install resize-image-loader --save-dev
```

**ResponsiveImage** component will take the multiple links, size and information and connect them together so that the browser can inteligently choose the optimal image.

```bash
bower install ResponsiveImage
```

# Speed with Ease - Bonus Round

"Perception" of speed is just as important actual speed.  

We can make the page feel faster by having a complete rendering faster. Loading a tiny inlined image and then blurring it with an SVG filter. It adds ~2KB per image. This will slow the inital render by ~0.1s but the page will feel much faster because it’s completely rendered. Once the responsive image loads, we’ll cross-fase between the two images.
