## Simplifying with Functional Programming

## Simplifying with Functional Programming

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Mutation</h3>
An object that is liable to change.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Immutable</h3>
An object that can NOT change.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Side Effect</h3>
When a procedure changes a variable from outside its scope.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">Pure Function</h3>
A function that does not mutate anything outside of it's own scope.

---

## Simplifying with Functional Programming

### What is Pure?

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];
(function(){
  x = [2,3,4];
}())
```

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];
for (var i=0; i < x.length; i++){
  x[i] = x[i] + 1;
}
```

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];
x.reduce(function(arr, i, idx){
  arr[idx] = i + 1;
  return arr;
}, x);
```

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];
x.map(function(i){ return i+1; });
```

```

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];

  x[i] = x[i] + 1; // mutates the array directly
}
```

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];
x.reduce(function(arr, i, idx){
  arr[idx] = i + 1;
  return arr;
}, x);  // passes in a reference to a mutable array
```

```javascript
var x = [1,2,3];
x.map(function(i){ return i+1; }); // The only side-effect free, pure function

## Pure Views – ƒ(d)=V

## Pure View Code

![](imgs/pure-view-code.png)

## Pure View Benefits

1. no side effects
1. with no ability to mutate, the only effect is creating a new object
1. isolating the scope makes it easy to see all possible branches
1. seperate the concerns of data and the concerns of users.
1. each unique static data object is a unique view
1. huge reduction in the brittleness of UIs
1. isolating factors mades it easy. Easy makes it composable. Composable makes it powerful.

# The Super Powers of Pure Views

A stack built on Pure Views, Immutable Data & Stateless Data Transforms.

---
## Hyper Reflexes - FPS Responsiveness

* global optimizations on render cycle
* higher FPS in most use cases
* minimize and batch DOM interactions ([http://bit.ly/stack-perf](http://bit.ly/stack-perf))
* highly optimized especially compared to string template systems (like handelbars and backbone)


---
## Hyper Speed - Server-side Prebooting

* to get to any state in the app only a static JSON is needed
* server-side prebooting for extreme page load speed WITH offline support

<img src="imgs/superpowers-preboot.png" style="width: 70%" />
---

## Quantum Entanglement - Real-Time Editing

* true real-time editing of code. not browser reloading.
* update layout, styles, view structure, event handlers *without* modifing application state

<video src="imgs/superpowers-hmr.mp4" onLoadeddata="javascript: this.currentTime = 1" onClick="javascript: this.play()" style="height:40%" />

---
## Shape Shifting/Impersonation - Smoke Testing Layouts

* sideload view stubs to test every layout and action
* unique URL params to navigate to any state
* dead code elimination removes view stubs on production builds

<video src="imgs/superpowers-snapshot.mp4" onLoadeddata="javascript: this.currentTime = 1" onClick="javascript: this.play()" style="width:90%" />

---

## Time Travel - Rewind/Fastforward for apps

* because application state is only data, it doesn't need to log events to record state mutations
* immutable data makes it trival to save each state change and play/rewind/fast-forward

<img src="imgs/superpowers-time-travel.gif" style="width: 60%"/>

---
## Teleportation - Switch devices maintain state

* immutable data makes logging every change to the data extermely iffecent
* record every change in real-time, serialize to the server and revieve on another device
* Switch from desktop to mobile web and maintain app state

---
## Telepathy - Record/Playback for Production Bugs

* teleportation also gives us the option serialize the application state when an excpetion is thrown
* don't think what the users saw or did, just replay it.
* dev just needs to pull down the record of mutations and scrub around to find the cause

---
## Resiliency over Rigidity

* Fully working app 1/4 the way through the build out
* unit test up the data layer without making any assumptions of the view
* UAT meeting fixed 7 of the 12 bugs within 30 seconds

<img src="imgs/fluxless-skeleton.gif" />

---

## Downsides

* some libraries don't play nice with pure functions, RxJS, D3 and jQuery.
* only a few framework options for iOS & Android.
