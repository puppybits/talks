        </h3>

          <p>All sites MUST load in under 2 seconds on a 3G connection(0.2MBps). Anything over 2 seconds and you'll have customer not want to return, not purchase your goods, not download your app or even worse they will abandon you before ever loading the first page. </p>
          <p>Images are the single large item on most websites. Doing a poor job on image handling will waste server resources and lose customers. Using ReactJS and Webpack you can easily speed up your site with little to no work.</p>

          </a>Power comes from browser knowledge.
        </h3>

          <p>In order to avoid jank and deliver fast user interfaces on the web, you need to know how the browser works. It is highly optimized for some types of operations and slow on others. In order to deliver a truely polished experiance developers need to understand what's going on.</p>
          <p>Your JavaScript is not to only place that needs optimzation. Decoding and rendering images take a lot of CPU time. When are you hammering on the CSS layout engine? How can you opt out of the extra operations and get as close to biltting pixels as possible.</p>
